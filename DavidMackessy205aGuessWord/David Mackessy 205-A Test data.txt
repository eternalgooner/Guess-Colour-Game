There are no run-time errors in the program.
I have carried out the following tests to make sure that the program conforms to the design specification.


TEST NUMBER:1
1 - When pressing the "START" button I expected to see the next current word 	displayed in asterisks form.
1 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:2
2 - When pressing the "ANSWER" button I expected to see the current word 	displayed in its original form.
2 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:3
3 - When pressing the "START" button I expected to see the lives counter 	reset and displayed as 8 in the appropriate field.
3 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:4
4 - When pressing the "ANSWER" button I expected to clear the Guesses 		Remaining field.
4 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:5
5 - When pressing a letter button, if the letter guessed was in the current 	word, I expected it to show the letter instead of the asterisk in its 	place and redisplay as an updated word.
5 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:6
6 - When pressing a letter button, if the letter guessed was not in the 	current word, I expected the lives counter to be decremented & 		redisplayed with its new value, in the appropriate field. 
6 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:7
7 - When the word has been guessed correctly and has more than 0 lives, I 	expected to see a dialog box displaying the message "You Win".
7 - Actual output was as expected.


TEST NUMBER:8
8 - When all lives have been used and the word has not been guessed 		correctly, I expected to see a dialog box with the message "You Lose".
8 - Actual output was as expected.
